# E-commerce website
E-commerce allows the buying and selling of goods or services over the internet. The predominant type of e-commerce is online retail or online shopping, which involves selling tangible products such as books, apparel, electronics, toys, groceries, and more on websites and mobile apps. Shoppers can browse items, add selections to a cart, proceed to checkout, and have the products delivered to them. Major online retailers include Amazon, eBay, Walmart, and others. 

In light of the widespread adoption of ecommerce and the substantial market potential it presents, expertise in building e-commerce solutions would make a software developer a strong candidate for many companies. Therefore, we are interested in building an online retail store website, similar to Amazon, from the ground up and hopefully gaining a comprehensive understanding of the design and technology stack behind e-commerce systems. We named it: BuyBee.
